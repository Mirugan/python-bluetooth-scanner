A simple JAVA example for listening to new events over XMPP.

We use the Smack library from ignite.  This code does work, most of the time. I think smack might be filtering the body
of the packets?

Apparently there is a library that supports Pub Subscribe, but I've never seen it used.

javac IQSubscribe.java -classpath smack_3_1_0/smack.jar:smack_3_1_0/smackx.jar

javac -classpath smack_3_1_0/smackx.jar SubClient.java

java -classpath smack_3_1_0/smackx.jar:. SubClient


TODO:

Deal with this using a packet extension, so I can parse the Messages.. etc..

Then.. implement subscribe in Python.

Finally:

modify the face detection script.. to make it essentially.. Minimal.
and send data over XMPP.  (in python)

Write Nokoscope to XMPP bridge.

Write tutorial for ejabberd.

Write replay.. ?

Jython XMPP to iRos.
